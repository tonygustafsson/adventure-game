opusframe
=========

This is a framework under development. It's not ment to be used in production anywhere!

Goal
=========

The goal is to create a fully functional PHP framework that helps out where it's needed without making the code slow.
It will take care of things like database connections, sorting, filtering, searching, pagination, form validation and such.
It's important that all extra features that is developed for this framework are modules that can be included or excluded
without any hussle.

For whom?
=========

This framework isn't for everyone. I don't want to fall in to the idea that the framework should do _everything_, and become
cluttered and slow. Instead I want a simple and clean framework that really makes development easier. If you are anything
like me, you will find opusframe kind of awesome - but in many cases you may want to consider another framework that does "everything".
